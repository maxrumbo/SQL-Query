# SQL-Query

---

## Welcome to maxrumbo's SQL-Query Repository!

This repository contains my **database projects and practical assignments** from database course. It's a structured collection showcasing the entire development lifecycle of database solutions.

---

## Repository Contents

* **Lab Reports (Laprak):** Each project includes a comprehensive report detailing the problem statement, design rationale, implementation steps, and outcomes.
* **CDM (Conceptual Data Model):** High-level data models illustrating the core entities and their relationships, independent of specific database technologies.
* **PDM (Physical Data Model):** Detailed data models that specify table structures, column definitions (data types, constraints), and explicit relationships as implemented in a specific database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams):** Visual representations of the database schema, clearly mapping out entities, attributes, and relationships.
* **SQL Code:** All executable SQL scripts, including:
    * **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Scripts for `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`.
    * **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Scripts for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations.
    * **DQL (Data Query Language):** Scripts for `SELECT` queries, covering various complexities from simple data retrieval to complex joins and aggregations.

## How to Use This Repository

Each project or assignment is organized into its own folder. Within each folder, you'll find the corresponding lab report, conceptual and physical data models, ERDs, and the complete set of SQL scripts used for that particular database solution.
